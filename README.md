## Summary

I'm a web developer, and I feel I am lucky that what I do is also something I find fun to do.

## About me
> No pain au chocolat, no gain au chocolat - Someone, somewhere.

I studied (and graduated) Psychology with a specialization in Behavioral Sciences - as unrelated as it gets.

Worked a little bit as student with clinical patients, cancer patients and autism patients, but sadly failed to find passion in clinical work. I felt a little of abstract problem-solving was missing for me.

After moving to Spain, I decided to jump deep into developing coding skills. And a few years later ~~I still suck~~, here I am, with a new skill that thankfully became my career.

_More_ random info about me:

<!-- WEB DEVELOPMENT -->
<details>
<summary><span>üë®‚Äçüíª&nbsp;Web Dev</span></summary>
After I got my head wrapped around the idea of having to learn to code. I went into <a href="https://codecademy.com">codecademy</a> and started doing the HTML, CSS and Javascript courses. Then I applied in coursera to a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-mobile-app-development">MEAN stack basic initiation course</a> (Mongo, Angular, Express, Node), and started dabbling around with my newfound knowledge in some personal projects; later some quick freelance work, fixing components and sometimes creating new ones.

I learned <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/html5/html5-original.svg'> HTML, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-original.svg'> CSS, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg'> Javascript
, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg'> Typescript, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/express/express-original.svg'> Express, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/angularjs/angularjs-original.svg'> Angular and some <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg'> Node in a very basic level before landing my first professional job.

[Here's a brief story on how I learned all of this at the time](https://github.com/gavaar/how_i_learned_to_code)

</details>

<!-- PSYCHOLOGY -->
<details>
<summary><span>üß†&nbsp;Psych</span></summary>
The biggest problem with psychology for me was its career paths. From which the only one that caught my attention was Academic research, but I'm divorced from Academia now. That was a toxic relationship.

I did really enjoy learning about behavioral sciences and all-things related to human behavior. Human consumer behavior and human biological impulses and it's effects on psychology and sociology are things that to this day catches my interest and was the basis for my dissertation to opt for the degree.

I'm trying to summarize all I have learned in a single place.
</details>

<!-- NUTRITION / FITNESS -->
<details>
<summary><span>üèãÔ∏è&nbsp;Nutrition / Fitness</span></summary>
This is another area in which I did not think I'd end up diving into... aaand here we are.

I've used myself as my own control group. Have tried keto diets, low-carbs, no-sugar, no-coffee, full-coffee, controlling glycemic index, etc. I am somehow still alive. I'm also an idiot, don't do this at home.

Started learning about for aesthetics. It shifted into me trying to get my body to be as stoic as possible for the longest time possible. We're all gonna die anyways, so let's just maximize that time in here.

Currently trying some type of [low-carb diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet) and focusing on strength training (akin to [powerlifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting) but not quite). Rather live strong than die weak.
</details>

<!-- GAMING -->
<details>
<summary><span>üéÆ&nbsp;Gaming</span></summary>
I have played games since I have memory. This is all my dad's fault (I thank him for it!).

I attribute some of my abilities to video games, so I think I will be gaming until I die. Nonetheless, games that do not take me to any mental limit or are not enterntaining, feel like a waste of time (at least for me).

Here's what I've been playing lately. Do judge me:

</p>
</details>

<!-- MUSIC -->
<details>
<summary><span>üé∂&nbsp;Music</span></summary>

If I limit my music to what I've always liked, I'd be missing on a lot of great things I have never given the chance to enjoy. If you're reading this just send me a song suggestion, I'll hear it.

<!-- EDUCATION -->
<details>
<summary><span>üìö&nbsp;Where I've learned</span></summary>

<img width="100" align="left" src="./assets/ucv.png">
<p>
    <strong>Bachelors in Psychology (2012-2017)</strong>
    <p>Five year career plan, for which three correspond to general knowledge, and the last two were for the specialization of Behavioral Sciences. Including internship, social services, and a dissertation.</p>
</p>

<img width="100" align="left" src="./assets/coursera_logo.png">
<p>
    <strong>Online Specialization on Mean Stack (Angular) (2018-2019)</strong>
    <p>Online specialization on the Mean stack focused on Angular, given by the Hong Kong University through the Coursera platform. It included Ionic and Nativescript at the moment, but right now these techs have evolved to the point to being very user-friendly. Now they also include a React alternative on their spec.</p>

    <p>Tried to help improving here-and-there with things like virtual scrolls (IntersectionObserver API), custom state management, map implementations, etc. Tried to provide from what I've learned. It's one of the best and most fun teams I've worked with and a place where I could learn about lacking aspects in my career, while also being very valued for what I could bring to the table.</p>

    <p>One of the best teams in which I could develop my skills. Amazing PO and relationship with the interested parties (Equifax, in this case). A lot of responsibility give to someone (me) willing to go the extra distance for the sake of learning. I did learn a lot and I hope we both ended up valuing the work we did here. One of the most supportive environments in which to learn.</p>

    <p>First developer job in Spain!. Very grateful with my former Tech Lead, thanks to him and the team I dived into I had one of the bests starts I could ask for in this world.</p>
