## Summary

I'm a web developer who went crazy and changed his career a few years ago. Now, I have become really passionate about the Javascript and Typescript world, having worked with different technologies on professional companies as well as stupid (and some not-as-much) personal projects.

> No pain au chocolat, no gain au chocolat

I'm a nerd on various subjects. I studied (and graduated) Psychology with a specialization in Behavioral Sciences. Worked a little bit as student in several areas, but I didn't find passion in clinical work, I required a little bit more of abstract problem-solving.

After moving to Spain, I decided to jump deep into learning development. And a few years later, here I am, a web developer that found joy in crashing his head against code problems!

Some random info about me:

<!-- WEB DEVELOPMENT -->
<details>
<summary><h3>👨‍💻&nbsp;Web Development&nbsp;👨‍💻</h3></summary>
After I got my head wrapped around the idea of having to learn to code. I went into <a href="https://codecademy.com">codecademy</a> and started doing the HTML, CSS and Javascript courses. Then I applied in coursera to a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-mobile-app-development">MEAN stack basic initiation course</a> (Mongo, Angular, Express, Node), and started dwabbling around with my newfound knowledge in some personal projects, and later some quick freelance work, fixing components and sometimes creating new ones.

I learned <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/html5/html5-original.svg'> HTML, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-original.svg'> CSS, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg'> Javascript
, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg'> Typescript, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/express/express-original.svg'> Express, <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/angularjs/angularjs-original.svg'> Angular and some <img height="16px" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg'> Node in a very basic level before landing my first professional job.
</details>

<!-- PSYCHOLOGY -->
<details>
<summary><h3>🧠&nbsp;Psychology&nbsp;🧠</h3></summary>
Even though I did not enjoy the professional aspects of Psychology, I did really enjoy learning about behavioral sciences and all-things related to human behavior. Human consumer behavior and human biological impulses and it's effects on psychology and sociology are things that to this day catches my interest. Currently, I'm trying to summarize all I have learned (without citing or academic-related stuff) in a single place in which I can update what I find with the latest information on Human Behavior.
</details>

<!-- NUTRITION / FITNESS -->
<details>
<summary><h3>🏋️&nbsp;Nutrition / Fitness&nbsp;🏋️</h3></summary>
This is another area in which I did not think I'd end up diving into. I started learning about this for the wrong purposes (trying to look better, etc). But down the road have learned a lot about nutrition, exercising, the ways muscles develop in different areas (energy / mechanical), and how eating one thing or another affects your ability to deliver in other very-unrelated areas. Glycemic index / Insulin response / Fasting, etc. As the day of this writing: I'm trying to live a life with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet">low-carb diet</a> (it's not a 0-carb diet though), and a heavy focus on strength-training (meaning, getting them muscles harder, not bigger).
</details>

<!-- GAMING -->
<details>
<summary><h3>🎮&nbsp;Gaming&nbsp;🎮</h3></summary>
I have played games since I have memory. This is all my dad's fault. Also, I do think games helped me develop my cognitive abilities so I think I will be gaming until I die. In this sense: at the time of this writing, you cand find me playing stuff like Stardew Valley, Dota2, Age of Empires IV, Elden Ring, and what not.

<summary><h3>🎶&nbsp;Music taste&nbsp;🎶</h3></summary>

Lately I've been going crazy about festivals. So, if possible, I'd like to attend as many as I can in the coming years. Here's some of the things I've been listening to:

<!-- EDUCATION -->
<details>
<summary><h3>📚&nbsp;Where I've learned&nbsp;📚</h3></summary>

<img width="100" align="left" src="./assets/ucv.png">
<p>
    <strong>Bachelors in Psychology (2012-2017)</strong>
    <p>Five year career plan, for which three correspond to general knowledge, and the last two were for the specialization of Behavioral Sciences. Including internship, social services, and a dissertation.</p>
</p>

<img width="100" align="left" src="./assets/coursera_logo.png">
<p>
    <strong>Online Specialization on Mean Stack (Angular) (2018-2019)</strong>
    <p>Online specialization on the Mean stack focused on Angular, given by the Hong Kong University through the Coursera platform. It included Ionic and Nativescript at the moment, but right now these techs have evolved to the point to being very user-friendly. Now they also include a React alternative on their spec.</p>

    <p>Tried to help improving here-and-there with things like virtual scrolls (IntersectionObserver API), custom state management, map implementations, etc. Tried to provide from what I've learned. It's one of the best and most fun teams I've worked with and a place where I could learn about lacking aspects in my career, while also being very valued for what I could bring to the table.</p>

    <p>One of the best teams in which I could develop my skills. Amazing PO and relationship with the interested parties (Equifax, in this case). A lot of responsibility give to someone (me) willing to go the extra distance for the sake of learning. I did learn a lot and I hope we both ended up valuing the work we did here. One of the most supportive environments in which to learn.</p>
